# Speech-to-Text-to-Language-Conversion
This project is made by using Python and its libraries 

The project can take an audio file as an input(.wav format).
The audio file would then be first converted into Text, stored in Json files and would be normalised for better understanding
Then it would be converted into a prefered language of choice, for testing i converted the text from the audio file from English to Urdu.
For testing whether the conversion is actually True and not just some jebberish, I used Google Translate and the results were positive.
